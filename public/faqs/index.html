            <h4>CAN I USE TALKPUSH FOR PROCESSING WALK-IN CANDIDATES?	</h4>
            <p>
Yes! You can manually add candidates through your online dashboard and they will receive an SMS and e-mail with instructions. The process is then the same as if they were a candidate contacting you via your job advert.</p>
<h4>
CAN I CONTINUE TO PROMOTE MY JOBS IN THE USUAL PLACES?	
</h4>
<p>
Yes! You can promote your job using your usual channels – the only difference is that you will forward all applications (via e-mail) to our system so that we can process the applications.
</p>

<h4>CAN I CREATE MY OWN INTERVIEW QUESTIONNAIRE AND RECORD MY OWN QUESTIONS?	</h4>
<p>
Absolutely! Talkpush will offer available templates for new users, but we actually encourage you to record your own questions, with your own voice, in order to take this opportunity for candidates to get a more personal experience regarding your company.</p>
<h4>
WHAT HAPPENS IF A CANDIDATE DIALS IN AND HIS PHONE DROPS OFF?	</h4>
<p>
No worries, Talkpush has already thought of everything. If the interview gets cut off because of a network or accidental disruption, the candidate will receive an invite to reconnect via SMS and email, and his interview is resumed at the very same question where it was left off. This way, every candidate gets a fair and equal shot at impressing you.
</p>
<h4>
WHICH COUNTRIES DO YOU OPERATE IN?	
</h4>
<p>
Talkpush is available in over 20 countries globally, including the United States, the United Kingdom, China, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and many more. Send us an inquiry to find out more.
</p>
<h4>
HOW CAN I INCREASE THE RESPONSE RATE FROM CANDIDATES?	
</h4>
<p>
Typically two concerns discourage candidates<br> – scam and constraint in speaking during office hours. You can make your invites more specific by adding your company name and the job title. You can also remind them that the dedicated phone line is available 24/7. Let them know that their recruitment process can start with a brief automated interview, even at midnight, if that happens to be the best time for them!
Other ways to increase response rate:<br>
– Reduce response time to candidates
Are candidates invited to participate as soon as they apply? If not, here’s how. You can ask your IT department to help you set up auto forwarding from the email account you collect CVs to Talkpush’s dedicated email account. Our system will automatically send out invites to candidates upon receiving the forwarded CVs.<br>
– Offer local dial-in options
If candidates are concerned about call charges, Talkpush can provide you with alternative dial-in option, including phone numbers from specific network providers, at an additional cost. Please contact Talkpush account manager to discuss.<br>
– Email customization
Did you edit your outbound email details so that your email invitation appears that it is coming from your company? You can do so by editing the SMTP details on your account settings. Please get help from your IT department to complete this section if needed.<br>
HOW DO I INVITE CANDIDATES TO PARTICIPATE MORE QUICKLY?	
You can ask your IT department to help you set up auto forwarding from the email account you collect CVs to Talkpush’s dedicated email account. Our system will automatically send out invites to candidates upon receiving the forwarded CVs.
</p>
<h4>
WOULD CANDIDATES NEED TO PAY EXTRA FOR LONG DISTANCE PHONE CALLS WHEN THEY DIAL IN?	</h4>
<p>
No. The dedicated phone lines are local numbers. So if you are recruiting candidates from areas outside your office region or even your country, your candidates will be making a local phone call only.
</p>
<h4>
CAN I SEND SMS MESSAGES TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE CANDIDATES WHO HAVE DIALLED IN?	</h4>
<p>
Yes! We provide standard text messages for shortlisted and rejected candidates. If you prefer, you can always customize your own too.</p>
<h4>
CAN I SHARE A CANDIDATE'S AUDIO FILES?	</h4>
<p>
Is it possible to share the audio recording from select candidates with people outside my team? Yes, you can share the audio recording by using the “Share” feature inside Talkpush.
 
Watch the tutorial below to see it in action.
 </p>


<h4>CAN I TRANSFER A PHONE CALL WITH A CANDIDATE DIRECTLY TO TALKPUSH?	</h4>
<p>
Yes, you can!
Please watch the video below

<p>

<h4>
HOW CAN I ADD MULTIPLE CANDIDATES AT ONCE?	</h4>
<p>
Using the email attachment method, you can now add multiple candidates at once. 
The process is simple:
Send an email to the email address dedicated to the job campaign with all the resumes (in .doc or .pdf format) as an attachment. Our parser will populate the campaign accordingly.
Caution: please limit the number of applicants to under 30 per email for the time being.
Note: Remember to switch on/off the auto email feature before adding the new candidates, depending on your preferences.
</p>
<h4>
HOW CAN I REACTIVATE A CANDIDATE?	
</h4>
<p>
If a candidate has not responded to your invite and one week has passed, the PIN code will expire. You can now create a new PIN code for candidates if you would like to recontact them. Simply select the candidate and press "Refresh PIN" in the menu above the selection.
</p>
<h4>
HOW IS THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF OUR DATA PROTECTED? IS THE SYSTEM COMPLETELY SECURE?	</h4>
<p>
Talkpush is using multiple layers of security to protect your organization's data from both inside and outside threats. Talkpush has not only deployed the industry's security standards such as SSL-encryption, Brute-Force protection and session expiry but has also developed features to cater to large organizations with different levels of hierarchy and access rights: Talkpush can be configured to only be accessible in specific networks (IP range blocking) or from users with e-mail addresses from your organization (account creation limitations). Furthermore, job campaigns can be set up to have different access of permission levels - depending on the information's confidentiality.
</p>
<h4>
WHAT IF THE CANDIDATE FORGETS TO DIAL IN BEFORE HIS/HER PIN CODE EXPIRED?	</h4>
<p>
There is no need to re-upload the CV. To get a new code, simply select the candidate and click Refresh PIN at the top. Here's how:

<p>
<h4>
HOW CAN I PERSONALIZE MY SMS AND EMAILS TO CANDIDATES?	</h4>
<p>
Talkpush allows you to automatically add the candidate's first name in all communications (SMS and emails) by simply adding this code: <%= @candidate_name %>
